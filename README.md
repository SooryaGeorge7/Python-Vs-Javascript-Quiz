[Link to Live Website](https://sooryageorge7.github.io/Python-Vs-Javascript-Quiz/)

How confident are you in knowing the difference between Python and Javascript ? 

Test your knowledge with this quiz in order to validate your knowledge(Yes, i used the term validate because testing just your website may not be enough!)

The languages Javascript and Python have a lot in common, but also subtle differences.They say that if you know one of them , its easier to learn the other. This statement may be true, but it is also very easy to misplace and confuse code syntax for either of the progamming languages. 

This quiz is aimed to help instill a lot of the differences between the two so that it is easier for user to code when they use either one of the languages in a program. 

The website is especially designed for newbies to coding or the tech world. When learning all the different languages at once, the information may be overwhelming and this quiz is created to help grasp the difference between the two languages in a fun, interactive way.

## Design

I wanted to keep the colour scheme to match with background video, and chose few colours to not overwhelm users when playing the game. The main colour which is a yellow-orange color was selected because it's a colour that  creates a sense of excitement and enthusiasm. The background video contains floating particles of a similar shade and it gived the illusion of diving deep into an alternate universe(usually how it feels when you code for hours!)

### Colour Scheme

The colours below are used in the following instances:
* #FF9F00 - Used for button colors,background colours, some texts. This is used as the main color..
* #C1C1C1 - Opted out of not using this in final design because there was no need, and inserting the colour made the area dull.
* #2B2B2B - Used as Primary and secondary text colors and as background color to contrast against the main color(#FF0F00).
* #FAF9F6 - Used as background color for answer buttons
* #226F54 - Used to alert user if answer clicked is correct- turns the button to this color and gives the section border the same shadow.
* #E04C4C - Used to alert user if answer clicked is incorrect- turns the button to this color and gives the section border the same shadow.

### Typography

I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to import the chosen fonts .

* [Noto Serif](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Serif?preview.text=JavaScript%20Vs%20Python&preview.text_type=custom&query=noto+serif&sort=popularity&noto.query=novecento) - Used for All headings and Questions.
* [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?preview.text=JavaScript%20Vs%20Python&preview.text_type=custom&query=open+sans&sort=popularity&noto.query=novecento) - Used for all other texts in game.

Noto Serif is a serif typeface created by Google specially for users to consume written digital content. I thought it would be appropriate for a quiz game which is educational.
I first got the heading font i wanted from Google fonts and i used [typ.io](https://typ.io/fonts/noto_serif) to get a font that it pairs well with .

### Imagery

I did not use any images , but my background video was chosen it gives the feeling of delving deep into the world of coding and programing languages. The credits for the background video is in [Credits](#credits) section.

### Wireframes

I created wireframes using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) for mobile, tablet and desktops screens.

#### Home Page

### Game Page 

![Game page](documentation/wireframes/wireframe-game-page.png)

### Score Page 

![Score page](documentation/wireframes/wireframe-scoreboard-page.png)

As i developed my game, My design for the game changed because of time constraints and implementations that would be beyond the project 2 scope at this point. 

### Features

The website is comprimised of a home page, game page, score page, how to play page and a 404 error page.

The Home page, Game page, Score page and How to play page are implemented in index.html. Css style display was used to hide and display the certain sections at certain points in the game. 

The 404 error page  is in a seperate html file called 404.html.

All sections in the game have the following in common: 

* The Quiz Heading(Located at top of every section of game.)

![Quiz Heading](documentation/quiz-heading.png)

* A Copyright statement(Located at the bottom of the page.)

![Copyright Statement](documentation/copyright-statement.png)

* The favicon (Located on browser tab.)

### Future implimentation

* I would implement a database that would allow all users scores and usernames to be stored so that new users would be able to compare their score to previous players. 
* I would implement a pause button, to allow users to stop the game in case of emergencies without having to restart the game again.
* I would want to be able to implement a share button that allows you to share this game to socials or peers. 


### Accessibility

These are the ways i have ensured to provide accessibility to users:

* Used HTML semantics.
* Ensured that user knows when their answer is correct or wrong by using red and green shade to highlight answer.
* Ensure that the user can see the score while playing (this would also help users that maybe color blind).
* Used rem and % for font sizes  throughout website because it can scale up or down according to user's device.
* Ensured Colour Contrast so that the websites are easily readable in light and dark mode.
* Provided alt for video incase images do not load.
* Aria labels were implemented for links and videos.[Learnt you can use aria-labels for videos here](https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/HTML/wiki/Media_Alt_Technologies)
* Google font "noto serif" was chosen carefully and i chose the pairing to this font "Open Sans" here [Noto serif pairing](https://typ.io/fonts/noto_serif).

## Testing

All testing was carried out in [Testing.md](TESTING.md).

### Solved Bugs
1. I wanted the answer that the user clicked on to turn green or red depending on if the selected answer was correct or wrong and then the color to return back to the original color after "click" event. - I first tried implementing this using event listner "click" without using any setTimeout(function()), but it did not allow the color to return back to original color. It just remained the red or green color after clicking. I first tried to solve this using mouse down, mouse up events and using that to change colours only when mouse is down, and then return to original colour when mouse is up again. Although this method worked fine on desktops, it did not work on mobiles as there is essentially no mouse being click on. This method would not work on touchscreen devices. I tried implementing touchstart and touch end but that triggered response when touching different areas of the screen. I then found a function that would allow something to change color for a few seconds here.https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5600351/javascript-change-css-color-for-5-seconds. This method allowed me to use click event and then use if else statement to changed color when clicking to either(red or green) and then i used setTimeout(function()) to change to color back to original color after 1 second. This function allowed the user to click on an answer(which triggered the answer to change color for the 1 second when user clicks )and then to return back to orginal color when the 1 second was up.
2. I wanted to position of the all sections(except header and footer) in the game to be centered on the screen- When using position: relative for this the sections are never at the center of the screen. I solved this by changing position to absolute, and adding left:50%;transform: translate(-50%, -50%); top:50%; in css stylesheet to the sections which allowed the main sections of the game to always be centered on any screen. 
3. My copyright statement was intially moving with the game section of the game. Have a look here to understand what i mean. I wanted the copy right statement to always remain at the bottom of the screen so changed position to fixed, and added left: 50%;
transform: translate(-50%, -50%); to achieve the effect of the statement always remaining at the bottom of any screen when playing the game.
4. I noticed after deploying that when i click username input field, the heading, sections and copyright statement overlap on my mobile. (only happens on mobile). I tried setting height to sections, margins , paddings, none of which worked. Only when setting the position of sections to relative that there were no overlap, but setting section's position to relative did not create the effect i wanted for my game ( wanting the game to be centered and copyright statement to always remain at the bottom of the screen)I realized none of this would have been a problem if i had not set my background to be a video. I had to set position to sections inorder for my sections to display over my background video. Then i found a solution here that allowed hiding of other sections using z-index. If i set my main section z-index to 2, and the header and and footer z-index to 1, the the overlapping effect would not be seen by user in smaller screens.
