# Python Vs Javascript Quiz



How confident are you in knowing the difference between Python and Javascript ? 
Test your knowledge with this quiz in order to validate your knowledge(Yes, i used the term validate because testing just your website may not be enough!)

The languages Javascript and Python have a lot in common, but also subtle differences.They say that if you know one of them , its easier to learn the other. This statement may be true, but it is also very easy to misplace and confuse code syntax for either of the progamming languages. 

This quiz is aimed to help instill a lot of the differences between the two so that it is easier for user to code when they use either one of the languages in a program. 

The website is especially designed for newbies to coding or the tech world. When learning all the different languages at once, the information may be overwhelming and this quiz is created to help grasp the difference between the two languages in a fun, interactive way.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The colours below are used in the following instances:
* #FF9F00 - Used for button colors and border around game area and heading.
* #C1C1C1 - Used for background color for game area.
* #2B2B2B & #FAF9F6 - Used as Primary and secondary text colors.
* #226F54 - Used to alert user if answer clicked is correct.
* #E04C4C - Used to alert user if answer clicked is incorrect.

### Typography

* [Noto Serif](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Serif?preview.text=JavaScript%20Vs%20Python&preview.text_type=custom&query=noto+serif&sort=popularity&noto.query=novecento) - Used for Game heading and Questions.
* [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?preview.text=JavaScript%20Vs%20Python&preview.text_type=custom&query=open+sans&sort=popularity&noto.query=novecento) - Used for all other texts in game.
Noto Serif is a serifed typeface created by Google specially for users to consume written digital content. So, naturally it is legible on the screen despite its decorate swashes.
I first got the heading font i wanted from Google fonts and i used [typ.io](https://typ.io/fonts/noto_serif) to get a font that it pairs well with .

### Imagery

### Wireframes

I created wireframes using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) for mobile, tablet and desktops screens.

#### Home Page

### Features

### Accessibility

I ensured to provide sufficient accessibility throughout the making of this game site by the following ways:

* I used semantic HTML.
* Ensures that there is sufficient colour contrast throughout the game site.
* Ensured that user knows when their answer is correct or wrong by using red and green shade to highlight answer.
* Ensure that the user can see the score while playing (this would also help users that maybe color blind).
* Allowed users to see their score in scoreboard to compare.
