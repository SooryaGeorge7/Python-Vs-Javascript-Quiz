# Python Vs Javascript Quiz

How confident are you in knowing the difference between Python and Javascript ? 
Test your knowledge with this quiz in order to validate your knowledge(Yes, i used the term validate because testing just your website may not be enough!)

The languages Javascript and Python have a lot in common, but also subtle differences.They say that if you know one of them , its easier to learn the other. This statement may be true, but it is also very easy to misplace and confuse code syntax for either of the progamming languages. 

This quiz is aimed to help instill a lot of the differences between the two so that it is easier for user to code when they use either one of the languages in a program. 

The website is especially designed for newbies to coding or the tech world. When learning all the different languages at once, the information may be overwhelming and this quiz is created to help grasp the difference between the two languages in a fun, interactive way.

### Typography

* [Noto Serif](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Serif?preview.text=JavaScript%20Vs%20Python&preview.text_type=custom&query=noto+serif&sort=popularity&noto.query=novecento) - Used for Game heading and Questions.
* [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?preview.text=JavaScript%20Vs%20Python&preview.text_type=custom&query=open+sans&sort=popularity&noto.query=novecento) - Used for all other texts in game.
Noto Serif is a serifed typeface created by Google specially for users to consume written digital content. So, naturally it is legible on the screen despite its decorate swashes.
I first got the heading font i wanted from Google fonts and i used [typ.io](https://typ.io/fonts/noto_serif) to get a font that it pairs well with .

### Imagery

### Wireframes

I created wireframes using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) for mobile, tablet and desktops screens.
