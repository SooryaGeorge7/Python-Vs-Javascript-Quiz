I used google developer tools throughout development of game to test different aspects and stages of the game.
I also used the console section in chrome dev tools to test javascript code and also to check and troubleshoot any issues that arise in the code too.

## Automated Testing 

### W3C Validator 

1. [W3C validation for index.html](documentation/tests/final-index.html-validation.png) - Passed
2. [W3C validation for 404.html](documentation/tests/404-html-validation.png) - Passed
3. [Jigsaw W3C Validation for style.css](documentation/tests/final-css-validation.png) 
  *  No errors, 
  * 2 warnings are : -webkit-background-clip is a vendor extension - Ive checked with CI tutor support if this would be a problem and they assured me that it wouldnt be since its a warning. I used that code to have a certain effect on my quiz heading. 


### JavaScript Validator 

1. [Js Hint validation for script.js](documentation/tests/script-javascript-validation.png) 
  * Initially had unused variables howtoPlay, playButton, validateMessage but i realized it was because i used onclick function in html instead of using event listners to call functions in javascript files. I corrected this.
  * Unused variable shown in validator called "questions" is from the questions array in questions.js. I checked with ci tutor support if this was okay, and they assured that i wouldnt lose points for that.
2.  [Js Hint validation for questions.js](documentation/tests/questions-js-validation.png)
  * The unused variable "questions" is used in script.js 

### Lighthouse

### Wave

![Wave test for quiz game](documentation/tests/wavetest-index.html.png)

The wave test alerts were for 8 possible headings and 1 X html5 video. 
* The possible headings was not valid in this case as its not a website but a game. 
* The video alert wasnt warrented in this case because its a background video that automatically plays itself, doesnt have audio or subtitles.I have added aria-labels to video in index.html incase video doesnt load or for people with vision impairments.
